# â˜• Caffeine

This PowerShell script file informs the system that it is in use, thereby preventing the system from entering sleep or turning off the display while the script is running.

Two different execution requirements can be enabled/ disabled using the PowerShell script:

1. Prevent the system from turning off the display  
   Forces the display to be on by resetting the display idle timer.
1. Prevent the system from entering sleep  
   Forces the system to be in the working state by resetting the system idle timer.
